Programme: creating your own language with the lambda calculus as the core.

Rough idea for the list of topics:
    
    * Session 1: Intro to the syntax and concepts of the lambda calculus, 
    including operational semantics.
    * Session 2: A first implementation: parsing, printing, and interpreting 
    the lambda calculus (written in Haskell)
    * Session 3: More on the implementation of a simple language based on 
    the Lambda Calculus
    * Session 4: Formally defining a type system via the simply-typed lambda 
    calculus
    * Session 5: Algorithmically defining a type system: type checking and 
    type inference
    * Session 6: Recursion and strong normalisation theorems
    * Session 7: Extending our implementation with some more features
    * Session 8: The Curry-Howard correspondence (types vs. logic)
    * Session 9: Polymorphism (System F)
    * Session 10: Implementing polymorphic types (Hindley-Milner algorithm 
    and related).
